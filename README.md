## Overview

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

‚ö° This challenge was to build a simple card layout for a QR component, using HTML and CSS.

üöÄ I built this utilising CSS Grid to place the card in the center of the page, and Flexbox (column) for the card content, using margins to space the content as shown in the design images, the best I could anyway. I did this with the help of [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/recent?fuid=1235937686138041576) (free version!). Here, I used the frame tool to add a desktop and mobile frame, with the widths that matched the style-guide.md of the project. Then I placed the design images inside, and adjusted the heights of the frames to match the images. I was then able to use a 'rectangle' (Fill #D9D9D9, 50%, and Stroke #FD5E5E, 100%, 1px) that I could move about and resize to measure the sizes of the items and gaps.
